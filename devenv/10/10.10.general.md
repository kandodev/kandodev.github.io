### Simple stuff
* Unpacking a tar.gz  
  * tar -xzf blah.tar.gz
* Check which shell you're using: echo $0
* Run previous command: !!
* Run the output of command you get as a command: `$(original command)`
* Find out who's listening on port 8080: `sudo lsof -n -i :8080 | grep LISTEN`


### Ssh tunnel
* Suppose the remote server only exposes a webserver to localhost:8888
* You can set up an ssh tunnel like so
`ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 -N codevion@123.456.789.90 -v`


### Screenshot
From [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/8yx7ju/i3_screenshot_application/e2eifsp/)
I use these commands:

```
# Desktop screenshot
bindsym --release Print exec "scrot ~/Bilder/Bildschirmfotos/$(date --iso-8601='seconds').png -m -e 'xclip -selection c -t image/png < $f'"
# Choose window
bindsym --release Mod1+Sys_Req exec "import -window `xwininfo | awk '/.*Window id:.*/ {print $4}'` ~/Bilder/Bildschirmfotos/$(date --iso-8601='seconds').png"
# Selection screenshot
bindsym --release Shift+Print exec "scrot ~/Bilder/Bildschirmfotos/$(date --iso-8601='seconds').png -s -e 'xclip -selection c -t image/png < $f'"
```

If I press `Print` it makes a screenshot of the entire screen, if I press `Shift`+`Print` it lets you select an area and if I press `Alt`+`Print`, it asks for a window to be selected to make a screenshot from. Additionally, it also copies them to the clipboard (expecept for the window one). I use `scrot` for most of them but because fedora's scrot does not have the option to make a screenshot from a certain window I had to use `import` (that's why it does not copy it to the clipboard because I have not figured out how to do that yet).

If you have a scrot version which supports that, however, it should probably be something like

```
bindsym --release Mod1+Print exec "scrot ~/Bilder/Bildschirmfotos/$(date --iso-8601='seconds').png -u -e 'xclip -selection c -t image/png < $f'"
```

Copying to clipboard is really useful for me because I send a lot of screenshots over messaging programs or sometimes copy them into GIMP.

### ssh
* Passwordless ssh to a host:
  * Ensure rsa key on current host: `ssh-keygen`
  * Copy your public key to server: `ssh-copy-id user@host.com`


### Useful commands
#### status
* lsusb : Lists all usb devices (including internal motherboard thingies?)
* rfkill: Tool to enable and disable wireless devices:
    `rfkill list` : list all devices
* dmesg: Kernel ring buffer...need to learn more

#### Terminal stuff
* Json stuff:
  * You can pipe any json to `json_pp` to pretty print it.
  * Alternatively also use `jq '.'` which is a more flexible json processor.

### SDAC Keeps disconnecting
My O2 SDAC kept disconnecting, then I followed the advice in https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-o2-sdac-dac-amp/talk#discussions and found the solution, to blacklist the drop SDAC for usb autosuspend by creating a file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-usb_power_save.rules` with the contents:

```
# blacklist drop sdac for usb autosuspend
	ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="21b4", ATTR{idProduct}=="0144", ATTR{power/autosuspend}="-1"
```

### XPS
