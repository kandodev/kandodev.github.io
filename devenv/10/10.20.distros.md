## Laptop
On Dell xps, had to create a file: `vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel-brightness.conf` with the contents:

```
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Card0"
        Driver          "intel"
        Option          "Backlight"     "/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight"
EndSection
```
to have backlight detect brightness
