### Adding ssh 
* If I add an entry like this to my `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host blah
  HostName blah.whatever.com
  User codevion
```
* Then I can use `rofi -show ssh` to auto ssh to blah with default terminal
### Scripting
* Rofi calls script once and every line of output from the script is one entry in rofi.
* Once you select an entry, rofi calls the script again and passes the entry as an argument to the script
* A simple script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -z "$@" ]]; then
  find $HOME/bin -type f
else
  bash -c $@
fi
```
* Can be run like `rofi -show fb -modi fb:.../scriptName.sh`
* `xdg-open http://google.com` will open google in default browser
