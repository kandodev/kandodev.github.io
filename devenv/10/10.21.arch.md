## Endeavor OS
* Had to boot from cpu gfx and then install nvidia drivers
* The colors sometimes have a weird tint in nvidia, need to fix with:
```
xrandr --output HDMI-0 --set CTM 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
```
* Upstream issue: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/4071
* Xfce4-terminal themes in
```
~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes
```
