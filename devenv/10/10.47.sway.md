# 10.47 Sway

This is the current source for my devenv. Set up currently on the x1 carbon on fedora.
Also take a look at [10.46.wayland](10.46.wayland)


* Getting a wifi clickable tray icon:
  * `exec nm-applet --indicator` in sway config

* Get all outputs/monitors
`swaymsg -t get_outputs`
* Disable a specific output
`swaymsg output <output> disable`

### Sound configuration
- `gnome-control-center sound`

### Waybar
Really good config: https://github.com/luispabon/sway-dotfiles/blob/master/configs/waybar/config

### Bluetooth
* blueman


### Get screensharing to work
Need to make sure `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` is installed. Then in chrome (chrome://flags) enable the flag: `enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer`

### Backlight
* Use the light tool
* `light -G` to get current brightness

### Screenshot
* To take screenshot and put into clipboard:
```
grim -g "$(slurp)" - | wl-copy
```
* To put it in file
```
grim -g "$(slurp)" blah.png
```

### Audio visualizer:
* cava (`sudo dnf install cava` on fedora)

### Swaylock
* In laptops with fingerprint, see https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock/issues/61#issuecomment-1236357015 to not have to enter pass twice
