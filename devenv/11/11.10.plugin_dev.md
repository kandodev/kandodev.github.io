# Neovim plugin dev
* Following https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/write-a-neovim-plugin-with-lua/
* Neovim's own guide: https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide

* API in three layers:
  * legacy vim api, accessed through `vim.cmd` and `vim.fn`
  * neovim api written in C accessed through `vim.api`
  * lua api written in lua accessed through `vim.*`
* Using lua:
  * Can use `:lua print("hello")`
  * Each `:lua` command has its own scope, state is not shared
  * `:lua=var` pretty prints value of variable/table
  * `:source file.lua` will run a lua script
  * How require works to load lua files from the runtime path (lua dir in neovim config dir)
  * To catch an error on load, we can use pcall():
    ```lua
    local ok, mymod = pcall(require, 'module_with_error')
    if not ok then
      print("Module had an error")
    else
      mymod.function()
    end
    ```
  * Require caches on load as well (different from source)
  *
