# [11.03] Neovim issues

## Rendering
### When I set the colorscheme, despite setting guibg to be none, area outside the vim text field does not respect no background

We need to include `EndOfBuffer` as well, like so:
```
vim.cmd [[hi normal guibg=none ctermbg=none]]
vim.cmd [[hi NonText guibg=none ctermbg=none]]
vim.cmd [[hi EndOfBuffer guibg=none ctermbg=none]]
```

### Gray bar on left side does not respect translucency (only on windows)
Still need to figure out why not. But 
```
set signcolumn=no
set foldcolumn=0
```
completely removes it. But I still need fold and sign indicators so need to figure out how to merge them into number column
