# Neorg

## Installing on M1 mac
- Had issue when running `:Neorg sync-parsers`
- Needed to install gcc `brew install gcc` and then run `CC=gcc-12 nvim -c "TSInstall norg"`

## Exporting
- Since vimwiki takes over markdown filetype, to export, we need to do: `:Neorg export to-file ~/blah.md markdown`
- Important that this will url encode urls which may break links
