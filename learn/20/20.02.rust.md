### Basics
* Documentation with `///` and can use markdown
* i32 is int
* implicit return, no semicolon needed
```rust
fn blah(x: i32) -> i32 { 
  x + 1 
}
```
* vars immutable by default, need to add `mut` keyword:
```
let mut mutable = 1;
```
* Type inference but can optionally provide.
* `&str` is string literal
* `String` is a heap allocated string stored as a vec
```
    let s: String = "hello world".to_string();
```
* A "slice" is an immutable view into a string or even a vector
* arrays with `[]`
* tuples with `()`
*
