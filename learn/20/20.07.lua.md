Closures
  * Lexical Scoping: When a function is written enclosed in another function, it has full access to local variables from the enclosing function.
  * First Class Functions: Functions and objects are treated as the same thing.
      * Passing them as arguments
      * Returning them as values
      * Assigning to variables/storing in data structures
