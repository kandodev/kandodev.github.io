Following [Learn Vimscript the hard way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/01.html)
### Echoing messages
* Just do `:echo "Hello, World!"`
* You can also do `:echom "Hello"` which also adds it to the set of `:messages`
* To make comments use quotes `" this is a comment`

### Setting options
* For boolean options, you specify `:set <name>` to set and `:set no<name>` to unset.
* You can also unset by setting opposite, e.g: `:set <name>!`
* You can check a value by: `:set <name>?`
* For non boolean options, set as `:set <name>=<value>`
* You can check them the usual way `:set <name>?`
* Setting multiple option values at once `:set <boolOption> <otherOption>=<val>`

### Basic Mapping
* You can map a key to an action: `:map - dd` will do `dd` when you press `-`
* Special keys like space represented as `<space>`
* Modifier keys: `<c-a>` represents `Ctrl+a`

### Modal Mapping
* You can specify the mode (normal, insert, visual) to do the mapping using `nmap`, `imap` and `vmap`
* Doing this in insert mode: `:imap <c-d> dd` won't actually delete the line but insert two d's.
  * To acheive the effect we want, use `:imap <c-d> <esc>ddi`

### Strict mapping
* To unmap use `:nunmap <key>`
* Using the above commands, vim takes into account all mappings! There could be  infinite recursion.
* Hence there's a way to map without taking into account other mappings: `:noremap`
* *Always* use `noremap`, `inoremap`, etc

### Leaders
* You can set a leader `:let leader = "-"`
* Then in mappings, use it `:nnoremap <leader>d dd` so our valuable keys are notoverwritten
* There's also `localleader` that only takes affect for certain types of files
*
