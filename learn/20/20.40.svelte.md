# [20.40] Svelte

## Entry point
As an entry point, there's maybe a main index.html:
```html
<body>
<div id="app"></div>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
</body>
```

which then loads the main.js:
```javascript
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById('app')
})

export default app
```

And then finally in the main App.svelte we can start writing svelte which is like html with some extra stuff

```
<script>
  // Code here
</script>

<main>
  <!-- jsx type things here -->
/main>

<style>
  <!-- styling here -->
</style>
```

## Basics
* Can import items with `import Counter from 'Counter.svelte'`
* Imports in the script tags
* Any variables in the script can be used in the body:
```
<script>
let world = 'world';
</script>
<h1>hello {world}</h1>
```

* If you have an array object, you can iterate over it like so:
```
<ul>
  {#each tasks as { id, title }, i}
    <ul> Task {i} has title {title} </ul>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

* You can have things running after the page loads so it doesn't slow down page loading using `onMount`
