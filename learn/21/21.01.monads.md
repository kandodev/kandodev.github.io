# 21.01 Monads

## Blog post on Monads
From https://ericlippert.com/2013/03/07/monads-part-five/

### Part 5
* Rule one of the monad 'pattern' is that we can always *wrap* a value of type `T` into an instance of `M<T>`. 
  * Let's say: `f: A -> M<A>`
* Rule two is that if you have a function `A -> R`, then you can apply that function to an instance of `M<A>` and obtain an instance of `M<R>`. 
  * Let's say `g: (M<A>, A -> R) -> M<R>`
* Rule three is that if you have a function from `A -> M<R>`, then you can apply that function to an instance of `M<A>` and obtain an instance of `M<R>`. Sort of like the result is _flattened_
  * Let's say `h: (M<A>, A -> M<R>) -> M<R>`

* Rule two is redundant and can be obtained by rules 1 and 3. The implementation would be:
  * `g(m: M<A>, func: A->R) = h(m, A -> f(func(A)))`

### Part 6 & 7
A monad is a generic type that 'amplifies' the power of a type T. We saw two rules in part 5, however, we need a few additional restrictions. 
1. Identity function:
  * Applying the 'make a wrapper around this value' function to a monad value must produce the same monad value.
  * i.e. `h(X, f) == X`
2. The result of applying a special function to a value, and to the same value "wrapped up in a monad", must be the same.
  * i.e. For some function `func: A -> M<A>`, `func(A) == h(f(A), func)`
3. Composition should be possible through the third rule above (`h`). 
  * i.e. For soem functions `func1: A -> M<A>` and `func2: A -> M<A>`, applying `func1` to some value `X` followed by `func2` to the result of `func1`, and their composition function `h(func1(X), func2)` must produce the same monadic values.

### Part 8
* Traditional name for `f` above is *unit*. (Called `return` in haskell...weirdly)
* Traditional name for `h` is *bind*. (In Haskell, it's an infix operator. e.g; to bind function `f` to monad `m`: `m >>== f`. Especially in haskell, bind is asynchronous, it sort of takes a workflow and a function, and returns a bound workflow, although something like Nullable is computed immediately.)

### Part 9
* Two patterns seen frequently in implementation of the monad:
  * Association of some state with a value
  * Construction of workflows that describe the sequencing of units of work to be performed in the future.
