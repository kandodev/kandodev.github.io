## Category Theory for Programmers

### Preface
* Traditional programming paradigms are wildly unsuited to composing concurrency. Using things like locks and mutexes makes it hard to code good concurrent code that is easy to debug.
* Growing complexity as well is reaching the limits where the side effects affect scalability.
* Side effects don't scale.

### 1. Category: The Essence of Composition
* Category: Objects and arrows that go between them.
* If an arrow goes from A -> B and from B -> C, then there must be an arrow from A -> C that is their composition.
* Think of the arrows as functions, if there's a function f: from type A to type B and g: from type B to type C, then we can compose a new function `g∘f` that goes from type A to type C. Or in code: `g(f(a))`
* In haskell: `f::A -> B`, `g::B->C` and then `g.f :: A -> C`, where the `::` denotes type

#### Properties of composition
1. Composition is associative: `h∘(g∘f) = (h∘g)∘f = h∘g∘f`
2. For every object A, there is an arrow which is a unit of composition. (An identity function on A)
  * In haskell: `id :: a -> a` and `id x = x`

Composition is the essence of programming
