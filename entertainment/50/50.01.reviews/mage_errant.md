### Mage Errant 1 (Into the Labyrinth) by John Bierce
3/5 - Good start but fails to deliver any depth
The premise of this book starts out interesting. In a magic school where the MC has difficulty doing magic and then a random adult shows up who shows how the standard method doesn't work too well and takes him and a couple of other notable mages as apprentices. This is a compelling premise to begin the story with but the problem is that we don't get to see the progression too much. There's a small bit about the MC finally overcoming his limitations to do a levitation charm, just with a lot of power because of his situation. This was the kind of stuff I wanted to see more of! But there's a distinct lack of this and nor any other interaction with the rest of the school or teachers after that. Beyond one bully, the author fails to make me understand what school is like and how his life changes. And before you know it, months have passed and the MC and his team are thrown in a dungeon which they barely survive and he gets a powerup which we later find out is a very big one. I would read the next book if it explored his school journey a little more. But the second book looks to be another adventure outside the school..
